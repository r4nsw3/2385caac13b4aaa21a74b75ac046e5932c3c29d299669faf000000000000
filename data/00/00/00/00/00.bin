  |   Think outside the box to save a world in peril! As Qbby or Qucy,      |
  |   you'll create boxes and use them to surmount more than 270 puzzling   |
  |   stages - the most in the series to date! The box planet is plagued    |
  |   with obstacles, so jump, climb, drift, ride, and warp your way past   |
  |   them in three modes, complete with their own stories, stages,         |
  |   challenges, and techniques. You can even team up for a 2-player       |
  |   adventure starring both star-crossed boxes!                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A Tale for Two is a new mode in which - for the first time in the     |
  |   series - two players can work together to solve puzzles... Or one     |
  |   brave player can alternate between Qbby and Qucy! On top of that,     |
  |   there's a third adventure starring Qudy, the tall one, and thanks     |
  |   to his extra-tall boxes, you'll even have to think outside the        |
  |   rectangle! As you beat stages, you'll uncover more, and if you're     |
  |   efficient, earn medals you can use to score everything from boxy      |
  |   accessories to simple comics to helpful items at the in-game shop.    |
  |   Got your eye on a sweet sailor costume? Then try Balloon Challenge:   |
  |   if you get all ten balloons before the time runs out, you'll score    |
  |   extra medals!                                                         |
